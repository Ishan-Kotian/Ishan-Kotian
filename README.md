# Hi there, I'm Ishan Kotian

üéì Graduate Student in Business Analytics at the Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota ‚Äì Twin Cities.

üíº Former Data Analyst at Capgemini with experience in Python, SQL and SAP HANA.

üîç Passionate about leveraging data to drive business insights and decision-making.



## About Me

I've always been fascinated by the stories numbers can tell. My journey into data science began during my undergraduate studies when I realized that analyzing data could lead to insights that change how we understand our world. As a Data Science Student Consultant at Carlson Analytics Lab, I contribute to developing an NLP-based grant-matching platform that streamlined processes for a top-tier medical research organization, saving 80+ hours weekly. Collaborated on live case projects using causal inference to analyze NCAA NIL policy effects, uncovering critical insights for athlete performance metrics. 

Currently pursuing an MS in Business Analytics at the University of Minnesota, I bring a foundation in data science and engineering from the University of Mumbai. With expertise in causal analysis, Python, SQL, R and Tableau, my goal is to leverage analytics to empower organizations in making strategic decisions that drive measurable outcomes.
