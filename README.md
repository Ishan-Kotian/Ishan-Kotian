## üìä Projects

Here are some of the projects I've worked on:

- [Cats vs. Dogs Image Classification using ResNet-50](https://github.com/Ishan-Kotian/Cats-vs-Dogs-Image-Classification-using-ResNet-50): Image classification of cats vs. dogs using transfer learning with ResNet-50. Achieved ~98% accuracy using Keras and TensorFlow on the Kaggle Dogs vs. Cats dataset.

- [Real-Time Movie Recommendation System](https://github.com/Ishan-Kotian/Real-Time-Movie-Recommendation-System): Developed a PySpark-based real-time recommendation engine as part of a semester-long project to personalize movie suggestions.

- [Predictive Models](https://github.com/Ishan-Kotian/Predictive-Models): Built five predictive models covering classification and regression tasks like cancer detection, car value estimation, and customer spending. Includes cost-sensitive modeling techniques.

- [Causal ROI Analysis of Sponsored Search Ads at Bazaar.com](https://github.com/Ishan-Kotian/Causal-ROI-Analysis-of-Sponsored-Search-Ads-at-Bazaar.com): Assessed ROI of sponsored search using Difference-in-Differences regression. Corrected pre-post biases to isolate true ad impact.

- [Measuring Display Ad Impact ‚Äì A Causal Analysis of Star Digital‚Äôs Campaign](https://github.com/Ishan-Kotian/Measuring-Display-Ad-Impact-A-Causal-Analysis-of-Star-Digital-s-Campaign): Evaluated a display ad campaign with randomized trial data. Used causal inference to quantify the ad's effect on user behavior.

- [Causal Inference with Experimental Data](https://github.com/Ishan-Kotian/Causal-Inference-with-Experimental-Data): Used R to analyze experimental impacts of Reddit Gold on engagement and a tutoring program on test scores. Applied statistical testing and DiD regression.
