# Hi there, I'm Ishan Kotian

üéì Graduate Student in Business Analytics at the Carlson School of Management, University of Minnesota ‚Äì Twin Cities.

üíº Former Data Analyst at Capgemini with experience in Python, SQL and SAP HANA.

## About Me

I've always believed that behind every dataset lies a story waiting to be told and an opportunity to drive impact. As an MS in Business Analytics graduate at the Carlson School of Management ('25), I combine a strong foundation in data science and engineering with hands-on consulting experience to help organizations turn data into strategic advantage.

My recent work at Carlson Analytics Lab includes:
- Developing an NLP-powered grant-matching platform for a top medical research organization, reducing manual review time by 80+ hours per week.
- Leading NCAA athlete data analyses using causal inference and experimental design, providing actionable policy and performance insights.
- Optimizing logistics through Python-based geospatial clustering, improving warehouse efficiency by 18%.

Previously at Capgemini, I automated global sales data pipelines (Python/SQL), built dashboards in Tableau, and delivered $2M+ revenue opportunities through advanced segmentation and pricing analytics.

I'm passionate about leveraging analytics to drive measurable business outcomes in product and marketing analytics. Let‚Äôs connect if you‚Äôre interested in data-driven decision making or have opportunities where analytics can make a difference!
